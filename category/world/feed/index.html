<p>Lions and lionesses&nbsp;<em>File photo: Reuters</em></p>



<p>The West Bengal branch of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (BHP), the religious wing of India&#8217;s main Hindutva organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), filed a plea in the circuit bench of the Calcutta High Court on Friday, which has sparked discussions across the country, including West Bengal, especially on social media.</p>



<p>In a petition before a bench of Justice Sougat Bhattacharya, BHP said a lion and a lioness were living in the same room at the Siliguri Safari Park in Jalpaiguri, North Bengal. However, their objection is not about lions living in the same house, but about names.</p>



<p>The lion&#8217;s name is Akbar. Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar was the most successful emperor of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. And the name of the lioness is Sita, who is the wife of the Hindu god Ramachandra in the Ramayana. BHP challenged the decision to keep them in the same room.</p>



<p>According to BHP, the forest department of the West Bengal government has deliberately named the two lions as Sita and Akbar. Hinduism is insulted by Sita&#8217;s living with Akbar. The religious organization has demanded a name change. The state forest authority and the director of the safari park have been impleaded in the case.</p>



<p>Forest department officials, however, claimed that they had not named the lions. The pair was recently brought from Tripura&#8217;s Sipahijala Zoological Park. They have been named in BJP-ruled Tripura. On February 13, Sita and Akbar arrived in West Bengal.</p>



<p>Justice Sougat Bhattacharya accepted BHP&#8217;s plea for hearing. The next hearing is scheduled for next Tuesday. While the names of Mughal emperors are being removed from various parks, streets and areas in Delhi, the full-grown lion of eastern India does not seem to be able to keep his name for much longer. There is a lot of discussion on social media about this issue.</p>

<p>Relatives break down in tears after receiving the body of a worker who died in a mine collapse&nbsp;<em>Photo: AFP</em></p>



<p>More than 20 people have died after an illegal gold mine collapsed in the southern jungles of Venezuela. Yesterday, Wednesday, local officials reported this information. An operation is underway to ascertain whether anyone else is trapped alive in the mine.</p>



<p>The incident happened last Tuesday in the &#8216;Bulla Loca&#8217; mine in Bolivar state, Venezuela. It takes about seven hours to reach the area by boat from the nearest town of La Paraguay. Family members of those who work in those coal mines are waiting in La Paraguay.</p>



<p>As many as 23 bodies had been recovered, Angostura municipality mayor Yorzi Archiniega told AFP on Wednesday night. Of these, 15 bodies arrived in La Paraguay by boat. Eight more bodies are being taken there.</p>



<p>Carlos PÃ©rez Ampueda, Brazil&#8217;s deputy minister for civil protection, posted a video of the incident on social media. He said many people were injured there. But he did not mention any number. Officials believe that around 200 workers were working in the mine at the time of the incident.</p>



<p>In the video, some men were working in the shallow water of the mine when suddenly a mud wall collapsed on them. Some managed to escape but many were trapped.</p>



<p>Bolivar state civil security minister Edgar Colina Reyes said the injured workers were being taken to a hospital in Ciudad Bolivar, the region&#8217;s main city, four hours from La Paraguay.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the family members of the miners are waiting on the coast to find their relatives. One of them burst into tears saying &#8216;Amar bhai, amar bhai, amar bhai&#8217; while taking a dead body off the boat.</p>



<p>Resident Robinson Basanta felt that such incidents were not unusual given the unsafe conditions that miners work in.</p>



<p>The Bolivar region is rich in gold, diamonds, iron, bauxite, quartz and coltan. In addition to state-run mines, there are also illegal mining operations.</p>



<p>At least 12 people died in a mine collapse in the same region in December last year.</p>



<p>Last year, Venezuela&#8217;s armed forces evicted nearly 14,000 illegal miners from Yapacana National Park in the neighboring Amazonas state.</p>

<p>Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) have already agreed to form a coalition government in Pakistan. After several days of power-sharing negotiations, the two parties reached an agreement on Tuesday night.</p>



<p>On the other hand, independent candidates supported by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) formally joined the Sunni Ittehad Council party on Wednesday. They are now going to be the opposition party in the parliament. In such a situation, Dawn has published an editorial today about what is going to happen in the coming days.</p>



<p>According to the editorial, according to the agreement between PPP and PML-N, Pakistan is once again getting a coalition government under the leadership of Shahbaz Sharif. The new government is set to take over less than seven months after the previous Shahbaz-led government was dissolved.</p>



<p>PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari has been nominated as President by PML-N and PPP. The Speaker of the National Assembly will be elected from the PML-N party. And the PPP leaders will be nominated as Senate Chairman and Governors of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.</p>



<p>The two parties will form the government together in the provincial assembly of Balochistan. However, there is no guarantee that PPP will provide support to PML-N in all its activities after the formation of the government even if the complications are resolved.</p>



<p>Only in the case of a no-confidence vote or the passage of an expenditure bill will PPP members vote for the PML-N. In other cases, PML-N will do as they wish.</p>



<p>The PTI-backed winning independents have already joined the Sunni Ittehad Council. With this, the Sunni Ittehad Council is now the single largest party in the National Assembly of Pakistan. In that context, it can be said that the PTI party is going to be the opposition party in the National Assembly. At the same time, the leader of the opposition party will also be elected from among them.</p>



<p>Shahbaz Sharif will have to face the biggest political test while running the government in such a situation. He did not really face any kind of opposition during the previous government.</p>



<p>It is said in the editorial, this year&#8217;s parliament will not be the same parliament. Shahbaz has to show bravery in this Parliament. Even the legitimacy of the government led by him may be challenged. It has been alleged that they are forming the government by &#8216;stealing the public&#8217; in the February 8 elections.</p>



<p>Shahbaz Sharif&#8217;s biggest task will be to clean up the mistakes made by his previous administration; Especially in the economic field.</p>



<p>A large section of the Pakistani public is angry with the election results. Citizens are almost bankrupt due to continued inflation. In such a situation, Pakistan&#8217;s economy needs major changes, but the task will not be easy for Shahbaz. He will surely face resistance from the people.</p>



<p>Shahbaz Sharif says he wants to &#8216;protect&#8217; Pakistan. However, many people are now looking at how long he can hold his position.</p>

<p>Malak Silmi&nbsp;<em>Photo: Taken from Facebook</em></p>



<p>Dearborn, Michigan is one of the cities in the United States where a large proportion of the Arab population lives. When I joined journalism, I found myself alone, even though there were people like me around. Others went on to study subjects such as engineering and medicine.</p>



<p>I grew up in the US in a town where people don&#8217;t really believe what they hear in the media. Because, here the news about the Middle East and Muslim and Arab community is printed or disseminated by hiding the wrong and real information for years. Most of the times we have seen us portrayed negatively or labeled as terrorists in the news pages. So the Arab families I grew up with never listened to these news stories.</p>



<p>In 2000, father moved to this city with his family. A man who has traveled around different countries, never thought of settling down, his family becomes a permanent address after the terrorist attacks of 9-11. He clung to the family and did not want to move anywhere. He built a protective circle around this city in his mind, which he rarely crossed.</p>



<p>I was only two years old at the time of 9-Eleven. So what effect it had at the time, I don&#8217;t remember. But I can say, I grew up in a family that never went anywhere except Jordan and Palestine. People used to visit Mackinac Island on summer vacation. And I didn&#8217;t set foot there until I was 21.</p>



<p>We went on a hike to the nearby Great Lakes. But I didn&#8217;t visit Lake Michigan, two and a half hours away. Because, to go there, you have to go through several Republican counties. And father used to think that since mother and I wear hijab, we might have to hear all sorts of bad things from which he cannot protect us.</p>



<p>I was quite angry with the &#8216;narrow&#8217; mentality of people in my community. Later I understood why my parents took such a decision for us. One reason for their fear was the US media coverage of the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and another was the Western policies of exploiting Muslims under the guise of anti-terrorist operations after 9/11.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>After seeing the printed report, I felt like crying in an empty apartment. It seemed that someone had stopped my voice. I was dying of shame for those protesting people.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I want to become a journalist to change this situation. I wanted to tell the right story and hold people in power accountable.</p>



<p>Taught in college, journalism can change government policies, expose their secret activities, lies, and exonerate the wrongfully convicted. These words are etched in my mind. I want to use this power for myself and my community, who have been the target of media and government censure day after day.</p>



<p>I started writing stories and reporting in the campus newspaper. Interned at several media organizations in Michigan. I even had the opportunity to intern at the New York Times for two weeks.</p>



<p>The family was enjoying this journalism of mine. After college, I got a full-time job at a local newspaper in Texas in 2021. I was the only Muslim and Palestinian in the newsroom there. I did about 400 reports there in a year on breaking news and trending topics.</p>



<p>Among these reports, there was one report, which I was hesitant to do or not. I regretted it later. It was a protest against a church raising funds for Israel.</p>

<p>Brazil is not having a good time in international football. Brazil&#8217;s national team has been struggling since its exit from the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Qatar . Not only the national team, but the country&#8217;s age group is also struggling. The champions of the last two Olympics could not pass the selection hurdle this time. Losing to arch-rivals Argentina , they are out of the regional qualifiers.</p>



<p>Even if Brazil can&#8217;t do well in the country&#8217;s jersey, their club football situation is not like that at all. Brazil&#8217;s Fluminense are the current champions of the Copa Libertadores, South America&#8217;s premier club football competition. Even looking at January&#8217;s reshuffle, Brazilian club football is in a state of flux. According to FIFA&#8217;s calculations, this time Brazil was on top of player &#8216;import-export&#8217;.</p>



<p>According to the information given by FIFA, 409 footballers went to play in Brazil from abroad during the winter transfer. Which is the highest among FIFA member countries. Brazil had to spend 12 million 26 million dollars to buy these players. In terms of the number of players, Brazil ranks fifth in terms of money. France is the most expensive. Clubs of the country spent 29 million 19 million dollars to buy 114 players. Which is 121 percent more than the same period of the previous year.</p>



<p>Portugal is number 2 behind Brazil. 252 footballers have registered there in this year&#8217;s team change. The country&#8217;s clubs have spent 41.5 million dollars to buy players. Brazil&#8217;s arch-rival Argentina is third in terms of players. It cost the country 40 million dollars to buy 226 players.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jimmy Neesham didn&#8217;t know the news &#8211; Shakib Al Hasan, Neesham&#8217;s teammate in Rangpur Riders in BPL, is playing with an eye problem. However, Shakib&#8217;s runs in the last three matches were 34, 27 and 69. Shakib&#8217;s wickets in these three matches are 3, 2 and 2. Is it possible to perform such an all-round performance with an eye problem or not &#8211; the question was playing on Nisham&#8217;s face after hearing the news after the practice of Rangpur today at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.</p>



<p>The all-rounder from New Zealand said with great surprise, &#8216;It seems that the opposite is helping him after seeing it in the last match. Maybe playing with one eye is easier for him (laughs). He is a great cricketer. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with his eyes. This is the first time I heard the news. Whatever he is doing, let him keep doing it. Because, it&#8217;s working (laughs).&#8217; Later he said, &#8216;Even if he can&#8217;t see, he can still bowl. He will do well in that too.&#8217;</p>



<p>He has seen Shakib as an opponent in international cricket for a long time. Now Nisham sees him as a teammate. Being an all-rounder himself, Neesham knows well the role of an all-rounder like Shakib in the team, &#8216;He is playing brilliantly for us. Having him in the team means having two players. He is one of the best batsmen and also one of the best bowlers. It is a great advantage to have him in the team. He has been performing well in the last few matches. Hopefully, he will retain this form.&#8217;</p>



<p>Shakib Al Hasan at Rangpur Riders practice in ChittagongProthom-alo<br>Neesham has played two matches in BPL so far. The Kiwi all-rounder contributed with the bat-ball to Rangpur&#8217;s win in both the matches. Naturally, Neesham is enjoying the time of BPL very much, &#8216;When you win, the game always seems enjoyable. The atmosphere of the team is quite good now. We are looking forward to the next match.&#8217;</p>



<p>Neesham is not having any problem to adapt as a foreign cricketer. Because the wicket made the work of the batsmen easier in the Chittagong phase of the BPL, &#8216;very good quality cricket is being played. There is a big run match. Which is good news as a batsman. Hopefully, we can play some more big run matches.&#8217;</p>



<p>Jimmy Neesham of Rangpur Riders faced the media in ChittagongProthom-alo<br>The topic of the national team also came up in the discussion of franchise T20 cricket with Neesham. The Bangladesh team has drawn the T20 series in New Zealand last December. Bangladesh, who performed well throughout the series, could have won the series, Neesham said, &#8216;We are lucky that we did not lose the series. If the last match was different, we could have lost the series.&#8217;</p>



<p>Nisham also noticed the continuous improvement of Bangladesh on foreign soil, &#8216;Bangladesh is doing very well in the last few visits to New Zealand. Progressing step by step. Especially the fast bowling department. Earlier, we have defeated Bangladesh by showing power in our conditions. Because, our condition is bouncy and our fast bowlers have more speed and bounce. But in the last two tours I see something differentâ¦Bangladesh team now has a bowler like Shariful. He can swing the ball with speed. Also has good bounce. They have played very well in New Zealand. They must be very happy about it.&#8217;</p>



<p>He sees a good chance of Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup next June, &#8216;There is also T20 World Cup ahead. I am sure, no team will take them lightly. Especially in West Indies conditions.&#8217;</p>

A press release said today that the decision was taken after a &#8216;thorough hearing process&#8217; and &#8216;consideration of all concerned&#8217; by the PCB committee. The PCB also said that he will not be allowed to play in any foreign league until June 30 this year.</p>



<p>Pakistan recently asked Rauf to play a Test in 2022 for the tour of Australia. However, although he initially agreed , he later withdrew himself from the tour , claimed the then new chief selector Wahab Riaz. Although at that time Rauf played the Big Bash League in Australia. Initially, he delayed giving the no-objection letter to play in the league , but later it was given to him by the PCB.</p>



<p>After Naseem Shah&#8217;s injury, Pakistan played with an inexperienced pace attack led by Shaheen Shah Afridi. Amer Jamals shined but they were washed up in the 3 Test series.</p>



<p>In the press release of Rauf&#8217;s contract cancellation, PCB said that Rauf did not want to join the Pakistan Test team for the tour of Australia. An inquiry committee was formed in this regard. After that it has been decided to cancel Rauf&#8217;s central contract from December 1, 2023.</p>



<p>It also said that Rauf was granted a personal hearing on January 30, &#8216;in accordance with the principles of justice&#8217;. But the PCB did not find anything satisfactory from his side. &#8220;PCB says, playing for Pakistan is the ultimate honor and opportunity for any player. Refusal to be a part of Test squad without medical report or justifiable reason is violation of central contract terms,â PCB said.</p>



<p>Today Rauf&#8217;s contract cancellation is the second big event in Pakistan cricket. Earlier, team director and acting head coach Mohammad Hafeez was &#8216;thankfully bid farewell&#8217; by them.</p>



<p>Recently , Syed Mohsin Raja Naqvi came to PCB as the fifth chairman in 15 months .</p>

<p>It takes time to sleep at night. But the sun will not rise at my will.&#8217;</p>



<p>A burnt-out life is somewhat philosophical. And all people have some kind of burn marks in their lives. Naushad Khan&#8217;s personal life may also have. But because of the burn he said above, it is not about himself. The scar is his son&#8217;s. The father also suffered from that pain. Sitting in the commentary room, Akash Chopra also smelled the burnt marks. It is understood that the stain is still fresh, but now it may disappear quickly.</p>



<p>If I get a Test cap, I will dedicate it to my father. Because he is my hero. Whenever I am in doubt, he directs me to the right path.<br>Dhruv Jurel<br>the scent? The burning smell is bitter. Naushad&#8217;s life has caught that now as a scent or fragrance. Like all other parents, many sacrifices are made in this one life to see the child where he/she wants to be because of his/her merits and still when the dream is not fulfilled, it burns deep inside. But parents don&#8217;t know how to give up for their children. When the dream comes true at the end of the hourglass of waiting and waiting, but the scent of happiness comes from that burnt scar. Happy pain in the chest!</p>



<p>Sarfaraz&#8217;s father Naushad hugs him after receiving his debut cap in the TestAFP<br>Naushad also got such a scent when his elder son Sarfaraz Khan made his international debut for India in Rajkot today. So the call was made in the commentary room as well. How do you feel as a father with such passion for your son, whether Abhishek was a little late or not &#8211; to know these things. That&#8217;s when Naushad gave this metaphorical example. When the word is broken, wait to be called to the national team to say &#8216;night&#8217;. At the end of that wait, Sarfraz emerged as the sun in the national team at the will of the selectors.</p>



<p>Or another &#8216;rising sun&#8217; Dhruva Jurel. This wicketkeeper-batsman also made his debut in the Indian jersey today. He did not have to play &#8216;Test&#8217; on a waiting wicket like Sarfraz. But Sarfraz&#8217;s Jurel&#8217;s story is similar to the sacrifice of his father and mother. Dinesh Karthik handed him the Test cap and said, &#8216;Your father must be watching this sceneâ¦.&#8217;</p>



<p>Jurel&#8217;s father Nem Singh Jurel is a Kargil War hero. He knows how much effort, how much sacrifice it takes to climb a steep mountain (success). At the age of 5, his son&#8217;s left leg fell under the wheels of a bus in Agra. I was not meant to be a cricketer. Dad didn&#8217;t want it in the beginning either. 14-year-old Jurel advised his son to focus on his studies after asking his father to buy cricket equipment. Because I want a government job. Baba knows the reality. But mother? Ah, all mothers in the world understand this!</p>



<p>Jurel&#8217;s mother sold the gold chain of her neck, fearing that her child&#8217;s dreams would be destroyed by her father&#8217;s rule. The more Jurel climbed the steep mountain, the softer his father&#8217;s heart became. And the son accepts that tender-hard father as &#8216;hero&#8217; &#8211; as most children do! Fathers are probably the first &#8216;superhero&#8217; in every child&#8217;s life. Jurel told the BCCI website, &#8216;If I get a Test cap, I will dedicate it to my father. Because he is my hero. Whenever I am in doubt, he directs me to the right path.&#8217; And mother? Mother&#8217;s ardent, immortal inexhaustible contribution to lightening their hardships, which children have!</p>

<p>Johan Cruyff Stadium, home ground of Barcelona women&#8217;s team. The Barca girls have made the stadium an impregnable fortress named after the late Dutch legend. It only became big news when the opposition returned home with 1 point from the Johan Cruyff Stadium. As the news is in Levante. Levante&#8217;s women&#8217;s team returned to Barcelona on Wednesday night with a 1-1 draw. Barca women&#8217;s team lost points after winning 79 consecutive matches in all competitions at home.</p>

<p>Rohit Sharma didn&#8217;t even open his helmet, just held the bat high. Standing at one end, the Indian captain saw the team&#8217;s 33 runs missing 3 wickets. He pulled the team from there, but his celebration after the century was tellingâhe knew there was work left to do. Ravindra Jadeja also did not open the helmet, his famous sword-swirling celebration was also &#8216;done for the sake of doing&#8217;. His reason, however, is different, Sarfaraz Khan, who played a great innings of 62 runs from 66 balls in an emotional debut, got run out due to a misunderstanding with him on the previous ball . Jadeja&#8217;s celebration left an impression on that. Bringing a smile as bright as a sunny day between the two, Sarfraz, who had been waiting for a &#8216;long&#8217; debut, picked up the bat, after half a century. Although he did not get the opportunity to go to three figures.</p>



<p>No matter how &#8216;white&#8217; the Indian milestone celebrations in Rajkot are, the first day belongs to them. Rohit and Jadeja&#8217;s century along with Sarfaraz&#8217;s quick half-century saw the hosts lose 5 wickets on the first day and collect 326 runs. Rohit returned with 131 runs, Jadeja unbeaten on 110 runs. His companion is night watchman Kuldeep Yadav.</p>



<p>On a wicket where batting is supposed to be helpful, after Mark Wood&#8217;s cannon, Tom Hartley won the toss in the first over and India quickly lost 3 wickets and came under pressure. But then Rohit and Jadeja explained the value of their wickets to England. The ever-active Ben Stokes made many changes in bowling and fielding but could not break the pair quickly. Promoted to five to retain the right-handed combination, Jadeja repaid the trust handsomely.</p>

<p>Although the wicket is very helpful for batting, there was uneven bounce in the beginning. Yasswi Jaiswal, who scored a double century in the previous Test, was caught at slip by Wood&#8217;s extra bounce ball, Shubman Gill was caught by Ben Folks to hold the line. Rajat Patidar also took a catch at cover while playing a little jump from outside the off stump. England got 3 wickets in the first hour. They could have got the wicket of Rohit, but Joe Root lost the chance at slip.</p>
