However, at the end of the month, the primary school teachers get a salary of 22 to 30 thousand taka, but the teachers of Ibtedayi Madrasa do not get any salary. Head teachers of 1 thousand 519 Ibtedayi madrasas get 2500 taka, assistant teachers get 2 thousand 300 taka. The rest of the registered madrasa teachers have been deprived of salary allowance for 39 years. So we are making a 7-point demand including nationalization of individual Ibtedayi Madrasas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also said that when we submitted our demands to the Education Minister on October 12 (2022), he assured us to implement the demands within 4 months. But even after 4 months and 2 years have passed, our demand has not been implemented. So today we are forced to form a human chain in view of our demand. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their 7 point demands are-&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To nationalize all individual Ibtedai \u200b\u200bMadrasahs registered with the Bangladesh Madrasa Education Board as primary schools; To provide all facilities including stipends to independent contributing students like primary students; Madrasa Education Board registered uncoded madrasas to be immediately included in the code number; Provision of PTI training for independent Ibtedai \u200b\u200bMadrasa teachers like primary teachers; Creation of fourth grade posts in independent Ibatedai \u200b\u200bmadrasas like primary schools; Provision of permanent registration of individual Ibtedayi Madrasahs like primary schools; and ensuring the physical infrastructure of individual Ibtedayi Madrasahs like primary schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, Kazi Mokhleshur Rahman, Chairman of Independent Madrasa Teachers Union, Secretary General of the organization was present in the human chain.
