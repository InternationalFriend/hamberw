However, their objection is not about lions living in the same house, but about names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lion&#8217;s name is Akbar. Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar was the most successful emperor of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. And the name of the lioness is Sita, who is the wife of the Hindu god Ramachandra in the Ramayana. BHP challenged the decision to keep them in the same room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to BHP, the forest department of the West Bengal government has deliberately named the two lions as Sita and Akbar. Hinduism is insulted by Sita&#8217;s living with Akbar. The religious organization has demanded a name change. The state forest authority and the director of the safari park have been impleaded in the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forest department officials, however, claimed that they had not named the lions. The pair was recently brought from Tripura&#8217;s Sipahijala Zoological Park. They have been named in BJP-ruled Tripura. On February 13, Sita and Akbar arrived in West Bengal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justice Sougat Bhattacharya accepted BHP&#8217;s plea for hearing. The next hearing is scheduled for next Tuesday. While the names of Mughal emperors are being removed from various parks, streets and areas in Delhi, the full-grown lion of eastern India does not seem to be able to keep his name for much longer. There is a lot of discussion on social media about this issue.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lions and lionesses&nbsp;File photo: Reuters The West Bengal branch of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (BHP), the religious wing of India&#8217;s main Hindutva organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), filed a plea in the circuit bench of the Calcutta High Court on Friday, which has sparked discussions across the country, including West Bengal, especially on social media.
