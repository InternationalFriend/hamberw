Therefore, whichever party the criminal belongs to, his justice must be ensured through the proper application of the prevailing laws of the country. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said that being an autonomous institution, it is not appropriate for the Ministry of Education to take direct action in the event of conflict or crime in the country&#8217;s universities.
