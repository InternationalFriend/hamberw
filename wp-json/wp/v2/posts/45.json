After his departure for 10 runs, Shubman Gill gave away the wicket for no runs. Only 5 runs come from the bat of Rajat Patidar who is down for four. After losing three wickets in short runs, Rohit and Jadeja managed the remaining time. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They took the team to a good position with a pair of 204 runs for the fourth wicket. The duo broke when Rohit returned with a catch by Ben Stokes&#8217; short ball from Mark Wood. The Indian captain returned after playing an innings of 131 runs with 14 fours and 3 sixes. However, he made several records by scoring a century. He surpassed Dhoni (211) in the list of sixes as a captain in international cricket. Rohit&#8217;s sixes are now 212 in three editions. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anointed Sarfraz came to bat at six. He shines at the crease. He picked up a 48-ball fifty in a stormy batting. There is another fastest fifty on Test debut for India, Yuvraj Singh&#8217;s 42-ball. However, this anointed batsman did not last long after picking up fifty. He was run out with 62 off 66 balls with 9 fours and 1 six. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jadeja got his century towards the end. He touched the fourth century of his career by spending 198 balls. This batsman is unbeaten with 110 runs off 212 balls. At the other end, unbeaten Kuldeep Yadav collected 1 run from 10 balls. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangladesh Time: 1900 hours, February 15, 2024<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When India lost 3 wickets for just 33 runs, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja pulled the team from the brink.
